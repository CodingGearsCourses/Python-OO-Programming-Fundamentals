Use the car class definition provided in the attached file (or code below). Convert it to an abstract class, and make all methods abstract.

Create an "Audi" class that uses "Car" as parent class.

Implement the methods with some pseudo code with some print statements & necessary validation.

For example, the Audi might have the maximum speed ranging between 160 to 260 miles/hour.

Use integers for speed, maximum speed, etc. to keep that area simple.

The real focus is on the inheritance, using properties, etc and make you think to assume few things to get the work done!
